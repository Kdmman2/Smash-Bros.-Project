    <p><div class="container">Super Smash Bros. 3DS/Wii U is the fourth installment in the Super Smash Bros. Series.
    For this reason, many fans call the game Smash 4. Smash 4 for the 3DS was released in North America on
    October 3rd, 2014. Whereas Smash 4 for the Wii U was release in North America on November 21st, 2014.
    Smash 4 on the Wii U had many advantages being on a more powerful console including better graphics, better performance,
    and other special game modes. Smash 4 on the 3DS lacked these, but instead had portability of being on a hand-held console
    as well as also having its own special game modes that could only be played on the 3DS copy of the game.
    The gameplay style of Smash 4 was tuned to be between the fast paced competitive style of Melee,
    and the slower, more casual style pace of Brawl. On release, Smash 4 included 51 playable characters, with
    7 extra characters later being added as DLC that players could buy. The game was praised for
    its expansive character roster, its improved machanics, and various other additions.
    One big complaint players had about the game was the lack of a single player story mode, such
    as the Subspace Emissary that was featured in Brawl. Super Smash Bros.
    for Wii U became the fastest-selling Wii U game in the U.S., with 490,000
    physical and digital copies sold during its first three days of release.<br></div>
